I finished my time in that infirmary.<br>
I already graduated from college and I end up NOT being a school doctor...<br>
Instead、I work for a third-rate company.<br>
I got bored at work one day (Most of the days、actually)<br>
So I surfed the internet.<br>
<br>
I suddenly remembered about that day...<br>
<br>
The day when Riku ran outside the infirmary、naked.<br>
I remember seeing his face... He was crying...<br>
<br>
I was scared...<br>
<br>
I was scared that I might use the word "love" wrongly<br>
Because I wasn't sure if he knew that word himself...<br>
I was scared that it would change about what he thinks about everything...<br>
<br>
In the end I screwed everything up.<br>
<br>
If only I was a bit more patient...<br>
I wouldn't have to spend everyday of my life like this...<br>
<br>
While they say that you shouldn't regret anything in life...<br>
I'm sure I regret this one...<br>
<br>
My life will continue to be gray<br>
<br>
If it does anything though...<br>
I would like to announce something.<br>
<br>
<br>
I like you、Riku. No. I love you.<br>
<br>
Even after a year、I love you.<br>
And it only grows stronger everyday.<br>
<br>
If only we can meet each other again...<br>
So that I can properly say it to you、Riku...<br>
