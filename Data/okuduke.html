Colophon<br><br>
Hello! Natsutama here!<br>
Thank you for getting this game!<br><br>
This is the first time that I'm making a FLASH visual novel game.<br>
I really like the theme of an adult and a kid.<br>
Do you like it as well?<br><br>
Anyway、enjoy!<br><br>

If there's a bug and you've been asked to download a new modified version...<br>
Please use the password below.<br><br>
「rikutokyokon」<br><br>

Also、like always、this is a work of fiction.<br>
If these stuff is illegal in your country/state、then be warned!<br>
Also、please don't use this as reference to anything (as some parts may talk about how to cure something).<br><br>

Hope to see you all in our next work! Cheers!<br><br><br><br>

If your FLASH doesn't work、you can get the new version <a href="http://www.adobe.com/jp/products/flashplayer/" target="_blank">here</a><br>
Also、the game might not work in some browsers.<br>
Please download a different browser if ever it doesn't work.<br>
Thank you!<br>
